## Quick start

### CKEditor 5 predefined builds

CKEditor 5 builds are a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. Every "build" provides a single type of editor with a set of features and a default configuration.

The following CKEditor 5 builds are currently available:

* [Classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#classic-editor)
* [Inline editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#inline-editor)
* [Balloon editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#balloon-editor)
* [Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#balloon-block-editor)
* [Document editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#document-editor)

#### Example

Creating an editor using a CKEditor 5 build is very simple and can be described in two steps:

1. Load the desired editor via the `<script>` tag.
2. Call the static `create()` method to create the editor.

In your HTML page add an element that CKEditor should replace:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the classic editor build (you can choose between [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/#ckeditor5), [npm](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#npm) and [zip downloads](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html#zip-download)):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/<version>/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the [`ClassicEditor.create()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_editor-classic_classiceditor-ClassicEditor.html#static-function-create) method:

```html
<script>
    ClassicEditor
        .create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
        .catch( error => {
            console.error( error );
        } );
</script>
```

Youâ€™re ready to go!

To find out how to start with other builds check the [Predefined builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/predefined-builds.html) guide in the CKEditor 5 documentation.

### CKEditor 5 Framework

CKEditor 5 builds allow you to quickly and easily initialize one of the many types of editors in your application. At the same time, CKEditor 5 is also a framework for creating custom-made rich text editing solutions.

To find out how to start building your own editor from scratch go to [CKEditor 5 Framework overview section of CKEditor 5 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/overview.html).

## Contributing and project organization

### Ideas and discussions

The development repository of CKEditor 5 is located at [https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5). This is the best place for bringing opinions and contributions. Letting the core team know if they are going in the right or wrong direction is great feedback and will be much appreciated!

### Development

CKEditor 5 is a modular, multi-package, [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) project. It consists of several packages that create the editing framework, based on which the feature packages are implemented.

The [ckeditor5](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5) repository is the place that centralizes the development of CKEditor 5. It bundles different packages into a single place, adding the necessary helper tools for the development workflow, like the builder and the test runner. [Basic information on how to set up the development environment](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/development-environment.html) can be found in the documentation.

See the [official contributors' guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/contributing.html) to learn how to contribute your code to the project.

### Reporting issues and feature requests

Each repository handles its issues independently. However, it is recommended to report issues in [this repository](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues) unless you know to which specific repository the issue belongs.
