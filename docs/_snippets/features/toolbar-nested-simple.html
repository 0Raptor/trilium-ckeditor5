		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Red Planet</a> is a target of human exploration for decades. Valeri Polyakov spent almost 438 days onboard the Mir space station to test the human ability to thrive in space for long periods of time. Unfortunately, Mars is still Planet of Robots, as only our automated representatives could visit it so far. However, humanity hopes to change this as soon as possible.
