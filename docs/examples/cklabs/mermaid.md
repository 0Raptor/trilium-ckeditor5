# Mermaid-enabled editor

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based tool for creating flowcharts and diagram visualizations. It uses a syntax Markdown-inspired to create and dynamically modify flowcharts. You can also check out a live implementation in [GitHub Writer](https://ckeditor.com/blog/github-writer-now-available-with-mermaid-support/).

The example below lets you test creating diagrams and flowcharts on the go, right during the content creation &mdash; no more screenshots that need to be re-created and re-uploaded each time something needs a change!
