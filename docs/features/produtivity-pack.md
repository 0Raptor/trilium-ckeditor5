# Productivity pack - overview

The productivity pack is a set of premium features for the CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor, that make editing faster, easier, and more efficient.

## Productivity pack features

### Content templates

The {@link features/template content templates feature} allows you to insert predefined content structures into the document. Templates can provide both smaller portions of content (e.g. a formatted table) and base structures for entire documents (e.g. a formal letter template).

### Document outline

The {@link features/document-outline document outline feature} lists the sections (headings) of the document next to the editor. The outline updates automatically as the user works on the document. It offers quick navigation to a specific section upon clicking.

### Format painter

The {@link features/format-painter format painter feature} lets you copy text formatting (such as bold, italic, font size, color, etc.) and apply it in a different place in the edited document. It helps keep the formatting consistent and speeds up the creation of rich content.

### Slash commands

The {@link features/slash-commands slash commands feature} lets you execute a command or any custom action by writing its name or alias directly in the editor. When you type a slash (<kbd>/</kbd>), the suggested commands are displayed in a panel next to it. You can also type a phrase after the <kbd>/</kbd> to filter the results in the panel and to easily find the desired command.

### Table of contents

The {@link features/table-of-contents table of contents feature} lets you insert a widget with a list of headings (section titles) that reflects the structure of the document and will be retained in the editor output data. The list stays up–to–date automatically as the user works on the document. Clicking a list item navigates the user to the corresponding document section.
