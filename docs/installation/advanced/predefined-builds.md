# Predefined CKEditor 5 builds

## Overview

Predefined CKEditor 5 builds are a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. Every "build" provides a single type of editor with a set of features and a default configuration. They provide convenient solutions that can be installed with no effort and that satisfy the most common editing use cases.

The following CKEditor 5 builds are currently available:

 * [Classic editor](#classic-editor)
 * [Inline editor](#inline-editor)
 * [Balloon editor](#balloon-editor)
 * [Balloon block editor](#balloon-block-editor)
 * [Document editor](#document-editor)


## Basic information

Each build was designed to satisfy as many use cases as possible. They differ in their UI, UX and features.

### When NOT to use predefined builds?

{@link framework/index CKEditor 5 Framework} or a {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other custom build} should be used, instead of predefined builds, in the following cases:

* When you want to create your own text editor and have full control over its every aspect, from UI to features.
* When the solution proposed by the builds does not fit your specific use case.

### Download options

There are several options to download predefined CKEditor 5 builds:

* [CDN](#cdn)
* [npm](#npm)
* [Online builder](#online-builder)
* [Zip download](#zip-download)

#### CDN

Predefined CKEditor 5 builds {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start can be loaded inside pages} directly from [CKEditor CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/#ckeditor5), which is optimized for worldwide super-fast content delivery. When using CDN no download is actually needed.  CKEditor is hosted on servers spread across the globe &ndash; the scripts are loaded faster because they are served from the nearest locations to the end user. If the same version of CKEditor has already been downloaded (even on a different website), it is loaded from cache. Using CDN reduces the number of HTTP requests handled by your server so it speeds it up as well.

However, CDN only offers ready-to-use, predefined packages &ndash; the builds &ndash; and as does not offer much customization capabilities.

#### npm

All predefined builds are released on npm. [Use this search link](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Ackeditor5-build%20maintainer%3Ackeditor) to view all official build packages available in npm.

Installing a build with npm is as simple as calling one of the following commands in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic
# Or:
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline
# Or:
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon
# Or:
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon-block
# Or:
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document
```

CKEditor 5 will then be available at `node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-[name]/build/ckeditor.js`. It can also be imported directly to your code by `require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-[name]' )`.

#### Online builder

The [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) lets you download CKEditor 5 builds and also allows you to create your own, customized builds (with a different set of plugins) in a few easy steps, through a simple and intuitive UI.

#### Zip download

Go to the [CKEditor 5 download page](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/download/) and download your preferred build. For example, you may download the `ckeditor5-build-classic-32.0.0.zip` file for the classic editor build.

Extract the `.zip` file into a dedicated directory inside your project. It is recommended to include the editor version in the directory name to ensure proper cache invalidation once a new version of CKEditor 5 is installed.

##### Included files

* `ckeditor.js` &ndash; The ready-to-use editor bundle, containing the editor and all plugins.
* `ckeditor.js.map` &ndash; The source map for the editor bundle.
* `translations/` &ndash; The editor UI translations (see {@link features/ui-language Setting the UI language}).
* `README.md` and `LICENSE.md`

### Loading the API

After downloading and installing a predefined CKEditor 5 build in your application, it is time to make the editor API available in your pages. For that purpose, it is enough to load the API entry point script:

```html
<script src="[ckeditor-build-path]/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Once the CKEditor script is loaded, you can {@link installation/getting-started/basic-api use the API} to create editors in your page.

<info-box>
	The `build/ckeditor.js` file is generated in the [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) so you can also import it into your application if you use CommonJS modules (like in Node.js) or AMD modules (like in Require.js). Read more in the {@link installation/getting-started/basic-api#umd-support Basic API guide}.
</info-box>

## Available builds

### Classic editor

Classic editor is what most users traditionally learnt to associate with a rich-text editor &mdash; a toolbar with an editing area placed in a specific position on the page, usually as a part of a form that you use to submit some content to the server.

During its initialization the editor hides the used editable element on the page and renders "instead" of it. This is why it is usually used to replace `<textarea>` elements.

In CKEditor 5 the concept of the "boxed" editor was reinvented:

 * The toolbar is now always visible when the user scrolls the page down.
 * The editor content is now placed inline in the page (without the surrounding `<iframe>` element) &mdash; it is now much easier to style it.
 * By default the editor now grows automatically with the content.

To try it out online, check the {@link examples/builds/classic-editor classic editor example}.

#### Installation example

In your HTML page add an element that CKEditor 5 should replace:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the classic editor build (here, the [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) location is used):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the {@link module:editor-classic/classiceditor~ClassicEditor#create `ClassicEditor.create()`} method.

```html
<script>
	ClassicEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

Full code example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>CKEditor 5 â€“ Classic editor</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Classic editor</h1>
	<div id="editor">
		<p>This is some sample content.</p>
	</div>
	<script>
		ClassicEditor
			.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
			.catch( error => {
				console.error( error );
			} );
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Inline editor

Inline editor comes with a floating toolbar that becomes visible when the editor is focused (e.g. by clicking it). Unlike classic editor, inline editor does not render *instead* of the given element, it simply makes it editable. As a consequence the styles of the edited content will be exactly the same before and after the editor is created.

A common scenario for using inline editor is offering users the possibility to edit content in its real location on a web page instead of doing it in a separate administration section.

{@img assets/img/editor-inline.png 776 Screenshot of an inline editor.}

To try it out online, check the {@link examples/builds/inline-editor inline editor example}.

#### Installation example

In your HTML page add an element that CKEditor 5 should make editable:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the inline editor build (here, the [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) location is used):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/inline/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the {@link module:editor-inline/inlineeditor~InlineEditor#create `InlineEditor.create()`} method.

```html
<script>
	InlineEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

Full code example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>CKEditor 5 - Inline editor</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/inline/ckeditor.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

### Balloon block editor

Balloon block is essentially the [balloon editor](#balloon-editor) with an extra block toolbar which can be accessed using the button attached to the editable content area and following the selection in the document. The toolbar gives an access to additional, blockâ€“level editing features.

{@img assets/img/editor-balloon-block.png 813 Screenshot of a balloon block toolbar editor.}

To try it out online, check the {@link examples/builds/balloon-block-editor balloon block editor example}.

#### Installation example

In your HTML page add an element that CKEditor 5 should make editable:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the balloon block editor build (here, the [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) location is used):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/balloon-block/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the {@link module:editor-balloon/ballooneditor~BalloonEditor#create `BalloonEditor.create()`} method.

```html
<script>
	BalloonEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

**Note:** You can configure the block toolbar items using the {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#blockToolbar `config.blockToolbar`} option.

Full code example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>CKEditor 5 â€“ Balloon block editor</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/balloon-block/ckeditor.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Balloon editor</h1>
	<div id="editor">
		<p>This is some sample content.</p>
	</div>
	<script>
		BalloonEditor
			.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
			.catch( error => {

### Document editor

The document editor is focused on rich-text editing experience similar to the native word processors. It works best for creating documents which are usually later printed or exported to PDF files.

{@img assets/img/editor-document.png 843 Screenshot of the user interface of the document editor.}

To try it out online, check the {@link examples/builds/document-editor document editor example}.

#### Installation example

Load the document editor build (here, the [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) location is used):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/decoupled-document/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the {@link module:editor-decoupled/decouplededitor~DecoupledEditor.create `DecoupledEditor.create()`} method. The decoupled editor requires you to inject the toolbar into the DOM and the best place to do that is somewhere in the promise chain (e.g. one of the `then( () => { ... } )` blocks).

<info-box>
	The following snippet will run the document editor but to make the most of it check out the {@link framework/guides/document-editor comprehensive tutorial} which explains stepâ€”byâ€”step how to configure and style the application for the best editing experience.
</info-box>

```html
<script>
	DecoupledEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.then( editor => {
			const toolbarContainer = document.querySelector( '#toolbar-container' );

			toolbarContainer.appendChild( editor.ui.view.toolbar.element );
		} )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

Full code example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>CKEditor 5 â€“ Document editor</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/decoupled-document/ckeditor.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Document editor</h1>

	<!-- The toolbar will be rendered in this container. -->
	<div id="toolbar-container"></div>

	<!-- This container will become the editable. -->
	<div id="editor">
		<p>This is the initial editor content.</p>
	</div>

	<script>
		DecoupledEditor
			.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
			.then( editor => {
				const toolbarContainer = document.querySelector( '#toolbar-container' );

				toolbarContainer.appendChild( editor.ui.view.toolbar.element );

			.catch( error => {

### Superbuild

The superbuild, available instantly from CDN, is a preconfigured package that offers access to almost all available plugins and all predefined editor types.

<info-box>
	Please consider, that the superbuild contains a really whole lot of code. A good portion of that code may not be needed in your implementation, so using the superbuild should be considered for evaluation purposes and tests rather, than for the production environment.

	We strongly advise using the {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#creating-custom-builds-with-online-builder Online builder} approach or {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#building-the-editor-from-source building the editor from source} to create customized and efficient production-environment solutions. You can also try out one of the other predefined builds instead.
</info-box>

#### Installation example

Please refer to the {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start CDN installation quick start} to learn how to utilize the superbuild.

## Build customization

Every build comes with a default set of features and their default configuration. Although the builds try to fit many use cases, they may still need to be adjusted in some integrations. The following modifications are possible:

 * You can override the default **configuration of features** (e.g. define different image styles or heading levels).
 * You can change the default **toolbar configuration** (e.g. remove undo/redo buttons).
 * You can also **remove features** (plugins).

Read more in the {@link installation/getting-started/configuration Configuration guide}.

If a build does not provide all the necessary features or you want to create a highly optimized build of the editor which will contain only the features that you require, you need to customize the build or create a brand new one.

A build is a simple [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package (usually developed in a Git repository) with a predefined set of dependencies. Out of this repository, distribution files can be generated through the build process.

Some of the reasons for creating custom builds are:

* Adding features which are not included in the existing builds, either from a third party or custom developed.
* Removing unnecessary features present in a build.
* Changing the {@link installation/getting-started/basic-api#creating-an-editor-with-create editor creator}.
* Changing the {@link framework/guides/theme-customization editor theme}.
* Changing the {@link features/ui-language localization language} of the editor.
* Enabling bug fixes which are still not a part of any public release.

<info-box hint>
	If you are looking for an easy way to create a custom build of CKEditor 5, check the [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/), which allows you to create a custom build through a simple and intuitive UI.
</info-box>

### Requirements

In order to start developing CKEditor 5 you will require:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.0.0+
* npm 5.7.1+ (**note:** some npm 5+ versions were known to cause [problems](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/16991), especially with deduplicating packages; upgrade npm when in doubt)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Forking an existing build

Start with [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) [the main `ckeditor5` repository](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5) (it will serve as the starting point for your customizations) and then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone -b stable git@github.com:<your-username>/ckeditor5.git
```

Builds are available in the `packages/` directory. The directories are named `ckeditor5-build-*`.
For example, use the following command to get to the classic build:

```bash
cd packages/ckeditor5-build-classic
```

To make updating easier, you may optionally add the original build repository to your Git remotes:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5.git
```

<info-box hint>
	If you do not want to fork the official build, you can just clone it. However, you will not be able to commit and push your customizations back to GitHub.

	Alternatively, instead of creating a custom build you can {@link installation/advanced/integrating-from-source integrate CKEditor 5 directly from source}. This option allows for even more flexibility and requires less overhead (you will not need to fork the official build). However, it requires that you fully control the `webpack.config.js` file (which is not that easy in some environments &mdash; for example in [`angular-cli`](https://cli.angular.io/) or [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).
</info-box>

<info-box warning>
	It is important that you use the `stable` branch of a build, not the `master` branch. The `master` branch might contain changes which are not yet compatible with the versions of CKEditor 5 source packages that were published on npm.
</info-box>

### Build anatomy

Every build contains the following files:

* `build/ckeditor.js` &ndash; The ready-to-use editor bundle, containing the editor and all plugins.
* `src/ckeditor.js` &ndash; The source entry point of the build. Based on it the `build/ckeditor.js` file is created by [webpack](https://webpack.js.org). It defines the editor creator, the list of plugins and the default configuration of a build.
* `webpack-config.js` &ndash; The webpack configuration used to build the editor.

### Customizing a build

In order to customize a build you need to:

* Install missing dependencies.
* Update the `src/ckeditor.js` file.
* Update the build (the editor bundle in `build/`).

#### Installing dependencies

First, you need to install dependencies which are already specified in the build's `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can add missing dependencies (i.e. packages you want to add to your build). The easiest way to do so is by typing:

```bash
npm install --save-dev <package-name>
```

This will install the package and add it to `package.json`. You can also edit `package.json` manually. Keep in mind, however, that all packages (excluding `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-*`) {@link installation/getting-started/installing-plugins#requirements must have the same version as the base editor package}.

<info-box hint>
	Due to the non-deterministic way how npm installs packages, it is recommended to run `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` when in doubt. This will prevent some packages from getting installed more than once in `node_modules/` (which might lead to broken builds).

	You can also give [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) a try.
</info-box>

#### Updating build configuration

If you added or removed dependencies, you will also need to modify the `src/ckeditor.js` file.

Every plugin that you want to include in the bundle should be added at this stage. You can also change the editor creator and specify the default editor configuration. For instance, your webpack entry file (`src/ckeditor.js`) may look like this:

```js
'use strict';

// The editor creator to use.
import ClassicEditorBase from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';

import EssentialsPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';
import AutoformatPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat/src/autoformat';
import BoldPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';
import ItalicPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';
import HeadingPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-heading/src/heading';
import LinkPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link/src/link';
import ListPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list/src/list';
import ParagraphPlugin from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';

import CustomPlugin from 'ckeditor5-custom-package/src/customplugin';
import OtherCustomPlugin from '../relative/path/to/some/othercustomplugin';

export default class ClassicEditor extends ClassicEditorBase {}

// Plugins to include in the build.
ClassicEditor.builtinPlugins = [
	EssentialsPlugin,
	AutoformatPlugin,
	BoldPlugin,
	ItalicPlugin,
	HeadingPlugin,
	LinkPlugin,
	ListPlugin,
	ParagraphPlugin,

	CustomPlugin,
	OtherCustomPlugin
];

ClassicEditor.defaultConfig = {
	toolbar: [ 'heading', '|', 'bold', 'italic', 'custombutton' ],

	// This value must be kept in sync with the language defined in webpack.config.js.
	language: 'en'
};
```

#### Rebuilding the bundle

After you changed the webpack entry file or updated some dependencies, it is time to rebuild the bundle. This will run a bundler (webpack) with a proper configuration (see `webpack.config.js`).

To do that, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can validate whether your new build works by opening the `sample/index.html` file in a browser (via HTTP, not as a local file). Make sure to **clear the cache**.

### Updating the build

You may decide to update your build at any time. Since it is a fork of the official build, you can simply merge the changes that happened meanwhile in that build, using Git commands:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/stable
```

You should handle eventual conflicts and verify the merged changes. After that, just follow the previous instructions for creating your build and test it.

<info-box hint>
	It is recommended to run `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` after you fetched changes from the upstream or updated versions of dependencies in `package.json` manually. This will prevent npm from installing packages more than once (which may lead to broken builds).
</info-box>

### Publishing your builds

If you think that your custom builds can be useful to others, it is a great idea to publish them on GitHub and npm. When doing so, just be sure to give them meaningful names that would fit the `ckeditor5-build-(the name)` pattern, making them easy to find. To avoid conflicts with other existing builds you can use [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope). We also recommend using the "ckeditor5" and "ckeditor5-build" [keywords](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#keywords) to make your build [easier to find](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:ckeditor5-build&page=1&ranking=optimal).

After your build is out, [ping us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ckeditor)!
