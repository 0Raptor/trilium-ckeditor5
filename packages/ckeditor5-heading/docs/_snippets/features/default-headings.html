	<h1>On the importance of headings</h1>
	<h2>What is a heading?</h2>
	<p>A heading is a title or a subtitle displayed in a document or webpage. Headings are created with the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> HTML tags where <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the main heading and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the lowest level heading.</p>
	<h2>Why use headings</h2>
	<p>Headings in a document serve a dual purpose: they help the creators and readers interact with the content and affect the way search engines index the webpage.</p>
	<h3>Human interaction</h3>
	<p>Having a clearly defined structure with sections and subsections is beneficial for both the creator and the readers. The creator can convey their message better and emphasize important parts. A few informative headings can help the readers scan the document in search for specific information.</p>
	<h3>Search engine indexing algorithms</h3>
	<p>Search engines use the headings to index the structure of the document and point to important keywords.</p>
