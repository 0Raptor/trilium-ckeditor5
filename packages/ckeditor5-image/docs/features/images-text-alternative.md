## Image text alternative

The {@link module:image/image~Image} feature adds support for plain images with just the `alt` attribute set. This translates to the following HTML:

```html
<figure class="image">
	<img src="..." alt="...">
</figure>
```

<info-box hint>
	This feature follows the markup proposed by the [Editor Recommendations](https://ckeditor.github.io/editor-recommendations/features/image.html) project.

You can see the demo of a WYSIWYG editor with the base image feature enabled below:

{@snippet features/image}

<info-box hint>
	The base image feature, unlike in CKEditor 4, does not support any user interface for inserting or managing images. Its sole purpose is to lay ground for other plugins (mentioned above) to build the target user experience. This pattern (composition of atomic features) is common for CKEditor 5 and allows the developers to build their own customized experience by implementing specific subfeatures differently.

## Common API

The {@link module:imagetextalternative/imagetextalternative~ImageTextAlternative} plugin registers:

* The {@link module:image/imagetextalternative/imagetextalternativecommand~ImageTextAlternativeCommand `'imageTextAlternative'` command}.
* The `'imageTextAlternative'` button.

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/guides/development-tools#ckeditor-5-inspector CKEditor 5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
